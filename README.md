# The FreeCodeCamp Project (Archived)

During my semester break in Spring 2025, I decided to explore web and app development. 
<br>
I believed that gaining skills in this area could be both interesting and valuable for my future.
<br><br>
Through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
<br><br>
However, before continuing with JavaScript, I decided to <b>switch to The Odin Project</b>.
<br><br>
#### I switched for the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Development happens outside the browser using tools like Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>It introduces essential developer workflows like version control with Git</li>
  <li>Youâ€™re encouraged to work more independently, with less step-by-step guidance</li>
  <li>The projects are more open-ended, challenging and allow more creativity</li>
</ul>
